# PurgeBot

## Another one-shot Discord microbot

Will clear as many messages in a target Discord text channel as the API will allow (14 Days worth if you let it) - Good for throwing on a cronjob for having an ethereal channel that wipes every so often

1. Paste your bot token into token.txt
2. Run `python purgebot.py [CHANNEL-ID]`
3. Watch those messages get slurped away

Requirements: 

**Discord.py, Python 3.8**
